# Spongebobify, the CLI!

I like mocking people, and frustratingly, mocking is difficult over text. Thankfully, a new avenue for expressing my mockery over text was introduced through the [Mocking Spongebob Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob).

Annoyingly, however, I'm really bad at typing out my mockery as fast as I can think it -- I needed a way to quickly transform my thoughts into mockery. Enter *Spongebobify, the CLI!*: the perfect CLI tool for making fun of people. 

(Also I've wanted to learn Rust for a few years and finally got around to starting on that. This is my first project (Hello World is project zero).)

## Instructions

1. Download/clone/unzip/extract/copy this very repo you're currently reading about.

2. Build using bog-standard `cargo build` (you of course have Rust installed, right?!?!)

3. Run the binary with the flag `--h` to learn the various commands.
